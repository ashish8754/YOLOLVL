# App Improvements Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures the successful deployment of three critical app improvements:
1. **Activity Deletion with Stat Reversal** - Users can delete activities and have stats properly reversed
2. **Infinite Stat Progression** - Stats can grow beyond the previous 5.0 ceiling
3. **UI Layout Fixes** - Floating Action Button positioning improvements

- [ ] High contrast and large text modes work properly

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Existing user data loads without issues
- [ ] Legacy activities can be processed correctly
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing workflows
- [ ] Migration scripts handle edge cases
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and documented

### 4. Performance Validation
- [ ] App startup time not significantly impacted
- [ ] Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
- [ ] Chart rendering performance acceptable with large values
- [ ] Database operations complete within reasonable time
- [ ] UI remains responsive during stat calculations

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Staging Environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run full test suite in staging
- [ ] Perform manual testing of all three improvements
- [ ] Validate with test data including edge cases
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows acceptable metrics
- [ ] Load testing with simulated user traffic

### Phase 2: Limited Production Rollout (10% of users)
- [ ] Deploy to 10% of production users
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Collect user feedback on new features
- [ ] Validate analytics and logging are working
- [ ] No critical issues reported within 24 hours

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (50% of users)
- [ ] Expand to 50% of users if Phase 2 successful
- [ ] Continue monitoring metrics and feedback
- [ ] Validate feature adoption rates
- [ ] Performance metrics remain stable
- [ ] Support team trained on new features

### Phase 4: Full Rollout (100% of users)
- [ ] Deploy to all users
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours post-deployment
- [ ] Validate all metrics are within expected ranges
- [ ] User feedback is predominantly positive
- [ ] No rollback required
