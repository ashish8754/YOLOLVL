### Help Documentation Updates

**FAQ Section:**

**Q: What happens when I delete an activity?**
A: When you delete an activity, your stats automatically reverse to reflect only your remaining activities. For example, if you delete a 1-hour workout that gave you +0.06 Strength, your Strength will decrease by 0.06. Your level may also adjust if you lose enough EXP.

**Q: Is there still a limit on how high my stats can go?**
A: No! We've removed the level 5 ceiling. Your stats can now grow infinitely. Whether you want to reach level 10, 100, or 1000 - keep leveling up!

**Q: Will deleting activities affect my level?**
A: Yes, if the deleted activity contained EXP that contributed to your current level, you may level down. Don't worry - this ensures your level accurately reflects your actual progress.

**Q: Can I still see my old activities after the update?**
A: Absolutely! All your existing activities remain unchanged. The new features only apply to future actions you choose to take.
